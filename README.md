# Ad3DGaFilt

Matlab Package for an Adaptive 3D Gaussian Filter (Ad3DGaFilt)

--- General Information ---

The Ad3DGaFilt is used for processing optical mapping data with low signal-to-noise ratios. All files have to be copied in one folder. The Ad3DGaFilt is called from the main script Ad3DGaFilt_Testscript.m.

This code was originally created and tested on a mac platform (64-bit machine) with Matlab version R2017b.
